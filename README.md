# ansible-react-node

### summary

This Ansible playbook is designed to set up a a react-js web application. The playbook performs the following tasks:

    Installs Node, PM2, nginx, curl, open ports for communications and test
    	backend service once started
    Includes secret variables from a separate file
    Starts the backend Node.js application using PM2, specifying the entry point (./server/app.js) and setting the environment variables NODE_ENV, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
    Starts the React frontend application using nginx

Ensure there is a `vars` directory in the project directory and contains the
vault secret for the `AWS` credentials, and a password file for the ansible
vault secret file that is generated by: `ansible-vault create ${SECRET_NAME.YAML}`. Also a `vars_file.yml` that contains all the variables to be injected into the ninja2 template of the ansible playbook.

To run the playbook:

```
ansible-playbook -i ${INVENTORY_FILE.ini} webapp_config_playbook.yml --vault-password-file=vars/${VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE}.txt
```
